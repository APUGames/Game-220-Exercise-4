Voice Over

## Assignment

You are tasked with recording voice over assets for an upcoming story based adventure game. 

You are to record the voice over assets for two characters, **Medi** and **Samsel**. **Medi** is a young sidekick companion to the main character. **Samsel** is a mystical old sage whose advice is not always helpful. Both characters' avatars are gender non-specific.

You will record voice over assets and deliver them, along with an updated `script-sheet.tsv` file.

You can read the lines yourself or reccruit voice over talent, but **You are required to be the recording engineer.**


### Audio asset requirements
- **Each file must be a 24bit, 44.1kHz Stereo .wav file.**
- Each sound should be in the `vo_takes` directory on the repo
- Filenames should be short, and start with the caracter name:
  - For example:
    - `Medi_a.wav`
- Each file should only contain takes for one line
- Multiple takes for each line are encouraged
  - please keep to one file per line reading
  - please edit out any extraenous sounds
  - keep ~2 seconds of silence between each take
- Each file should be peak normalized to -5 dBFs
- Each take should have minimal background noise and room reflections
- Each take should be close mic'd
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at beginning
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at ending


### Communication
If needed, please leave any notes on the sounds provided in the `Voice Talent Notes` field.

An script sheet / asset list is provided with a list of requested lines. **Update `script-sheet.tsv` with the filename, and any notes you have for the game designer.** Notes should be clear in meaning and directed toward the Game Designer in how to use the sound.

## How to edit .tsv files

`.tsv` files are plain text files for tabular data. They can be opened with spreadsheet apps like Excel, Numbers, and/or Google Sheets. If you use spreadsheet apps to edit the Asset List, be sure that you Save As or Export a tsv file. 

Here's a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbXL-ZrprCw) on how to import and export TSV files with Google Sheets.

Since TSV files are plain text, they can be edited with any text editor. Each column in a row is separated by a tab, each row separated by a line break.
